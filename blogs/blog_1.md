## Today's happenings and why I think Murphy's Law is a thing

Today was off to a good start. I had plans to crack my sequence project open, apply to 10 places, work on my algorithms and data structures, and then meet with some friends of mine. Then life happens and you lose sight of your goals for the day. If it was a one-off situation I would not be concerned. However, this is a daily occurrence for me.

I know the skill to work on one task and then work on another different task is called context switching. Doing it back to back is multitasking, a very difficult and draining skill. I believe that when you multitask you will eventually lose sight of things unless you follow a plan. I made a plan, but things came up and distracted me. Dogs got in the pantry and they might have found your stash of chocolate. Friends call to let you know they won't be making it to the meeting. Your eye gets caught on a notification. Before you know it, you lost the time you set aside and now you're playing catchup.

So no matter what, things will always come up to distract you. That is Murphy doing his thing. Not all distractions are created equal. You may find your phone going off, or your favorite social app, making you look away from your work. That is a distraction that you can control. Family emergency, not so much.

In order to control this, I decided to reduce these distractions by setting blocks of time for each activity along with a goal to accomplish (time boxing). Then I would silence all the devices and mute my sound so that it was just me and the task at hand. If I found myself looking away from the screen then I note what it was that grabbed my attention in a notepad. By the end of the day, I would have a list of distractions where I could see what was grabbing my attention the most. When I would try it the next day, I would see if I could mitigate the largest distraction on the list.

I know that there are some things you cannot do without like knowing if your family is okay. I get that, but if you look at the do not disturb feature on your phone, you will see that it can be set up to allow specific notifications through. I've never personally used this feature, but when you start to google for ideas on how to control the environment around you, you will find that this is a common theme.

In short, time boxing and multitasking are important skills to have but you can increase the efficiency of those skills by removing distractions from your environment. Otherwise, you will end up feeling flustered as your plans get derailed and make it difficult for you to recover.

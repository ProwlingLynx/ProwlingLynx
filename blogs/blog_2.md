## Wins
 1. I've shaped my GitHub profile enough to not fidget over it.
 2. I spent time with my family.
 3. I congratulated my friends on starting their new jobs.

## Using the GUI

Don't get me wrong, I've converted to using the CLI for most of my day-to-day work. However, I still use the GUI for most everything else. When I started to learn about computers I was shown how to work a mouse before I knew how to type. Today we can say that we learn to touch the screen before we even look at a mouse. The point I want to make is that it easier to use a GUI because it's an intuitive interface and is generally accessible to a larger audience.

On the other hand, using the CLI requires that you understand the commands and arguments that you are using. Even if you are just copying and pasting it from stack overflow, you have to understand why you are doing it or you will run into errors.

## Using the CLI

The CLI is a powerful tool that gives you the ability to do things that are not explicitly supported by the GUI. For example, want to make multiple files with ascending numbers? You can do that with the CLI. You can do it with the GUI too, but you will be doing a lot of repetitive work.

So now it is a question of whether or not you like to multitask.

## Context switching
I wrote in an earlier post about context switching and managing distractions. In this case, using the keyboard and then switching to the mouse is a context switch.
I found that reducing the instances I needed to switch over to a mouse to help maintain a good workflow.
What I am not saying is that it is faster to use the mouse, but I find it easier and more enjoyable to use the keyboard for all tasks.

At first, it is very difficult to memorize all the shortcuts on the keyboard and the syntax for the CLI.
What worked for me is to stop every time I reached for the mouse and look up if there is a keybinding to what I was trying to do. Once I found it, I used it and carried on. Granted I still reach for the mouse when I need to browse the web, but I have reduced the overall number of times I do so elsewhere.
The biggest point in using the keyboard and the CLI by extension is that it just looks cool to see your windows and code moving without that pesky mouse. :]

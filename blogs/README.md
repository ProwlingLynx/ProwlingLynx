# Welcome
If you found this blog by navigating my GitHub profile you have my thanks. Even if not, you still have my thanks for reading this far.

I do intend to create a more colorful and interesting site to house my blog posts. Right now I want to have momentum on my side versus putting it off because I'm afraid to post more publically and all other manners of excuses.

I hope you enjoy your stay.

## Why blog?
I have a friend named Susan Zhou [GitHub](https://github.com/ZhouSusan) who is a passionate software engineer. I met her when we were trying to get into Hack Reactor back in the summer of 2021. We didn't make it in together but we stayed in touch and became friends. She would tell me how she was rejected multiple times but persisted in eventually graduating from Coding Dojo. She proved that persistence would eventually win.

One day as we were talking about the current job market, she asked what steps I was taking to improve my chances. That's when she suggested blogging. I know the merits of doing this because I've blogged in the past but didn't publish the entries. The idea stuck and now I have this. A compromise between blogging on a platform and blogging in public.

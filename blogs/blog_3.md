## Why C#?
Up to this point, I have only used Javascript as my main programming language. I don't have a problem with Javascript, it's very flexible and easy to use. I have to admit, I am very skewed towards using a function for everything. I understand classes exist, but to this point I prefer functions. So, I need to pick up a language that encourages the use of classes. Plus there is always the hope of making a game in the spare time a la Unity.

Note: I am not picking it up for ease of use or the ecosystem. I am also aware that C languages are considered harder to learn than Javascript.

## What are the goals?

The end goal is to have written a full stack app in C# by next week Thursday. This will put a time frame to gauge where I'm at and where I am losing time.

What will the app look like to know that I learned something?
  - It will be a todo list app. Serves a page on screen with a list of todos that are stored in a database. You can remove or add them via events on the page. It will also have specific routing for the events.

Aren't there a million tutorials for this?
  - Yes, but I will avoid them if I can help it. The idea is to get comfortable with the language and the concepts.

The stretch goal then would be to solve a new medium problem on Leetcode using C#.

The list:
 - [ ] Write a "Hello World" statement that prints "Hello World" to the console using C#.
 - [ ] Write a HTTP server that responds with "Hello World" to a specific route.
 - [ ] Write a server that interfaces with an sql database using C#.
 - [ ] Write a server that serves up a static HTML page.
 - [ ] Choose a front end framework and write a HTML page that when served will display "Hello World".
 - [ ] Create a todo list app.
 Bonus:
    - [ ] Solve a medium problem on Leetcode using C#.

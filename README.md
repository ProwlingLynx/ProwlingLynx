# <a id="greetings"></a> Greetings All!
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Javier Tamez and I am a software engineer, a Hack Reactor alumni, web developer, and stubbornly curious. At the time of writing this, I am also an active job seeker looking to break into the tech industry.

Here you will find my beautifully unorganized repositories that range from shiny baubles I've found in the wild to my most recent personal projects like my fledgling markdown blog experiment. I do enjoy it when people come to visit my profile and see what I've been up to. If you would like to chat, then reach out to me on LinkedIn or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

## <a id="blog"></a> Blog
Here is an idea that was given to me: write your thoughts down so you can commit them to memory and then share them with others so you can continue to grow and learn.

I have a resistance to writing my thoughts down publically in all truthfulness. Something about knowing the world will be able to scrutinize my thoughts and knowing I will eventually write something factually wrong scares me. To say I am uncomfortable is an understatement. So to make the experience a bit more comfortable, and hopefully more fun, I intend to write a blog post every day using this public repository until I get a site up and running to house my thoughts.

I don't have any real way to have public feedback at this time, but feel free to reach out via [my contact details](#contact-me)

Without further ado, here is my temporary solution for blogging: [Blogs](https://github.com/ProwlingLynx)

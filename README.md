# <a id="greetings"></a>Greetings All!
Welcome to my github profile!

My name is Javier Tamez and I am a software engineer. This beautiful collection of unorganized repositories range from shiny baubles I've found in the wild to my most recent personal projects. Feel free to go through them and see what I've been up to.
